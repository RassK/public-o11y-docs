Automatic discovery and configuration for Windows automatically finds applications running in your Windows environment and captures telemetry data from them. The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector receives this data and sends it to Splunk Observability Cloud.

Using automatic discovery, you don't have to manually instrument or configure your applications before deploying them.
