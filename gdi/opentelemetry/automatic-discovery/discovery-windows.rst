    <h2>Get started</h2>

The Collector for Windows does not support automatic discovery of third-party services.

To enable the Collector's zero-code instrumentation of back-end applications written in .NET see :ref:`windows-backend-auto-discovery`. With this option you won't have to install and configure your instrumentation agents separately.
