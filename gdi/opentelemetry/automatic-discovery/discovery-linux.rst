    <h2>Get started</h2>

To enable the Collector's zero-code instrumentation of back-end applications written in Java, Node.js, and .NET see :ref:`linux-backend-auto-discovery`. With this option you won't have to install and configure your instrumentation agents separately. 

To use the Collector's automatic discovery and configuration of third-party applications in Linux environments see :ref:`linux-third-party`. With this option you'll only have to reuse a config file automatically generated by the Collector. 

For advanced auto discovery configuration see :ref:`linux-advanced-auto-discovery-config`.
