Automatic discovery and configuration for Kubernetes automatically finds applications running in your Kubernetes environments and captures telemetry data from them. The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector receives this data and sends it to Splunk Observability Cloud.

Using automatic discovery, you don't have to manually instrument or configure your applications before deploying them.

Automatic discovery for Kubernetes supports both back-end applications (such as Java and Node.js) as well as third-party applications (such as databases and web servers).

To use automatic discovery for back-end applications, see :ref:`k8s-backend-auto-discovery`. 

To use automatic discovery with third-party applications, see :ref:`k8s-third-party`.
