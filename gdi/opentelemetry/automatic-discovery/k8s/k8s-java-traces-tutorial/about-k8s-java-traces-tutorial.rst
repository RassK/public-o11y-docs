    <h2> How to use this tutorial</h2>

Follow the tutorial parts in order:

#. Configure your Kubernetes environment to install the OpenTelemetry Collector. See :ref:`config-k8s-for-java`
#. Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector and Spring PetClinic Java application. See :ref:`deploy-collector-k8s-java`
#. View your application data in Splunk APM. See :ref:`k8s-java-view-apm`

The tutorial uses the Spring Petclinic Java application as an example. To learn more about this application and to see a demo, see the Spring Petclinic website: :new-page:`https://spring-petclinic.github.io/`.
