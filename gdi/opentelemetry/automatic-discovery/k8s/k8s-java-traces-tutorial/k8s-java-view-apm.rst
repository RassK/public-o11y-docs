Part 3: View your data in Splunk APM
********************************************

Before you can view data in Splunk Application Performance Monitoring (APM), make sure that the application is active and generating data. Send requests to the application through ``cURL`` or interact with the application's UI to generate activity.

Follow these steps to start viewing your data:

#. Navigate to the Splunk Observability Cloud home page.
#. Select :guilabel:`APM`.
#. Search for your service by using the :guilabel:`Environment` filter or by entering your service name in the search bar. It might take a few minutes for your service to appear in APM.

The :guilabel:`spring-petclinic` service appears in the results:

    :alt: The Spring Petclinic service appears as a search result in the APM page.

Next, select the service. A page with detailed APM data opens:

You've now successfully deployed and instrumented a Java application in Kubernetes, and you can now see your data in Splunk APM.
