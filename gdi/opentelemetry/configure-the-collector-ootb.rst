Collector default configuration

      :description: Configure the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector. There are a variety of default configuration files available, as well additional components that can be configured.

.. include:: /_includes/collector-components.rst

The Collector configuration is stored in a :new-page:`YAML file <https://yaml.org/>` and specifies the behavior of the different components and services. See an overview of the elements and pipelines in the default configuration in the following sections.

Default configuration 
========================================================

This is the default configuration file for the Linux (Debian/RPM) and Windows Installer collector packages:

.. github:: yaml
  :url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/main/cmd/otelcol/config/collector/agent_config.yaml

Default pipelines
========================================================

By default, ingested data follows these pipelines.

Default pipelines for logs 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following diagram shows the default logs pipeline:

.. mermaid:: 

   flowchart LR

      accTitle: Default logs pipeline diagram
      accDescr: Receivers send logs to the logs/memory_limiter processor. The logs/memory_limiter processor sends logs to the batch processor, and the batch processor sends logs to the resource detection processor. The resource detection processor sends logs to the exporter. The SignalFx logs pipeline follows the same steps, but uses internal receivers, processors, and exporters to send logs.

Default pipelines for metrics 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following diagram shows the default metrics pipeline:

.. mermaid::

      accTitle: Default metric pipeline diagram
      accDescr: Receivers send logs to the metrics/memory_limiter processor. The metrics/memory_limiter processor sends metrics to the batch processor, and the batch processor sends metrics to the resource detection processor. The resource detection processor sends metrics to the exporter. The internal metrics pipeline follows the same steps, but uses internal receivers, processors, and exporters to send metrics.

Default pipelines for traces

The following diagram shows the default traces pipeline:

.. mermaid::

      accTitle: Default traces pipeline diagram
      accDescr: Receivers send traces to the traces/memory_limiter processor. The traces/memory_limiter processor sends traces to the batch processor, and the batch processor sends traces to the resource detection processor. The resource detection processor sends traces to the Splunk APM exporter and the SignalFx exporter.
