Splunk OpenTelemetry Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation provides several packages that automatically instrument your back-end applications and services to capture and report distributed traces and metrics to the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, and then on to Splunk APM.

The following diagram demonstrates the process of manually instrumenting your applications compared to the process of using zero configuration auto instrumentation to instrument your applications:

      Z["Run your application"]

      end


The Zero Configuration packages provide the following benefits:

- You can start streaming traces and monitor distributed applications with Splunk APM in minutes.
- You don't need to configure or instrument your back-end services or applications before deployment.

The following packages are available:

- :ref:`auto-instrumentation-java`
- :ref:`auto-instrumentation-dotnet`

.. note:: You can also install the Collector with the Kubernetes Operator for Auto Instrumentation. See :ref:`Install the Collector with the Kubernetes Operator <auto-instrumentation-operator>` for more information.
