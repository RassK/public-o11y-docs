Splunk OpenTelemetry Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation automatically instruments your back-end applications and services to capture and report distributed traces and metrics to the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, and then on to Splunk APM.

The following diagram demonstrates the process of manually instrumenting your applications:

The Zero Configuration packages provide the following benefits:

- You can start streaming traces and monitor distributed applications with Splunk APM in minutes.
- You don't need to configure or instrument your back-end services or applications before deployment.

Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation is available for Java, .NET, and Node.js applications.
