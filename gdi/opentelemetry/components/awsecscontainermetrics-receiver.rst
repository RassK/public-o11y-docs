      :description: The AWS ECS Container Metrics Receiver (awsecscontainermetrics) reads task metadata and docker stats from Amazon ECS Task Metadata Endpoint, and generates resource usage metrics (such as CPU, memory, network, and disk) from them.  

The Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector supports the AWS ECS container metrics receiver. Documentation is planned for a future release.

To find information about this component in the meantime, see :new-page:`AWS ECS container metrics receiver <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/awsecscontainermetricsreceiver>` on GitHub.
