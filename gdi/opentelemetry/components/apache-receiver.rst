      :description: The Apache Web Server receiver fetches stats from a Apache Web Server instance.

The Apache Web Server receiver fetches stats from an Apache Web Server instance using the ``server-status?auto endpoint``. The supported pipeline type is ``metrics``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

Prerequisites
======================

This receiver supports Apache Web Server version 2.4 or higher.

In order to receive server statistics, you must configure the server's ``httpd.conf`` file to enable status support. Learn more at Apache's official documentation :new-page:`Module mod_status <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html>`.

Get started
======================

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
   - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
   - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configuration
--------------------------------

To activate the Apache Web Server receiver, add ``apache`` to the ``receivers`` section of your configuration file: 

.. code-block:: yaml

  receivers:
    apache:
      endpoint: "http://localhost:8080/server-status?auto"
      collection_interval: 10s

To complete the configuration, include the receiver in the ``metrics`` pipeline of the ``service`` section of your configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

  service:
    pipelines:
      metrics:
        receivers: [apache]

Configuration options
-----------------------

The following settings are required:

* ``endpoint``. ``"http://localhost:8080/server-status?auto"`` by default. The URL of the httpd status endpoint.

The following settings are optional:

* ``collection_interval``. ``10s`` by default. Sets the interval this receiver collects metrics on. 
  
  * This value must be a string readable by Golang's ``time.ParseDuration``. Learn more at Go's official documentation :new-page:`ParseDuration function <https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration>`.
  
  * Valid time units are ``ns``, ``us`` (or ``Âµs``), ``ms``, ``s``, ``m``, ``h``.

* ``initial_delay``. ``1s`` by default. Determines how long this receiver waits before starting.
