********************************************
Authenticator - Bearer extension
********************************************

.. meta::
      :description: Implements both ``configauth.ServerAuthenticator`` and ``configauth.ClientAuthenticator``. It can be used in both http and gRPC exporters inside the ``auth`` settings to embed a static token for every RPC call made. 

The Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector supports the Authenticator - Bearer extension. Documentation is planned for a future release. 

To find information about this component in the meantime, see :new-page:`Authenticator Bearer extension <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/bearertokenauthextension>` on GitHub.
