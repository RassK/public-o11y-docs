OTLP/HTTP exporter

      :description: The OTLP/HTTP exporter allows the OpenTelemetry Collector to send metrics, traces, and logs via HTTP using the OTLP format. Read on to learn how to configure the component.

The OTLP/HTTP exporter sends metrics, traces, and logs via HTTP using the OTLP format (``application/x-protobuf`` content-type). See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

For information on the OTLP exporter, see :ref:`otlp-exporter`.

Get started
======================

The OTLP/HTTP exporter is not included in the default configuration of the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector.

If you want to add it, the following settings are required:

* ``endpoint``. The target base URL to send data to, for example ``https://example.com:4318``. No default value. 

  * Each type of signal is added to this base URL. For example, for traces, ``https://example.com:4318/v1/traces``.

The following settings are optional:

* ``logs_endpoint``. The target URL to send log data to. 
  
  * For example, ``https://example.com:4318/v1/logs``.
  * If this setting is present, the endpoint setting is ignored for logs.

* ``metrics_endpoint``. The target URL to send metric data to. 
  
  * For example, ``https://example.com:4318/v1/metrics``.
  * If this setting is present, the endpoint setting is ignored for metrics.

* ``traces_endpoint``. The target URL to send trace data to. 
  
  * For example, ``https://example.com:4318/v1/traces``.
  * If this setting is present, the endpoint setting is ignored for traces.

* ``tls``. See :ref:`TLS Configuration Settings <otlphttp-exporter-settings>` in this document for the full set of available options. 

* ``timeout``. ``30s`` by default. HTTP request time limit. For details see :new-page:`https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Client`.

* ``read_buffer_size``. ``0`` by default. ReadBufferSize for HTTP client.

* ``write_buffer_size``. ``512 * 1024`` by default. WriteBufferSize for the HTTP client.

Sample configurations
--------------------------------

This is a sample configuration for the exporter:

.. code-block:: yaml


  exporters:
    otlphttp:
      endpoint: https://example.com:4318

Detailed sample configuration
--------------------------------

This is a detailed configuration example:

.. code-block:: yaml


  endpoint: "https://1.2.3.4:1234"
  tls:
    ca_file: /var/lib/mycert.pem
    cert_file: certfile
    key_file: keyfile
    insecure: true
  timeout: 10s
  read_buffer_size: 123
  write_buffer_size: 345
  sending_queue:
    enabled: true
    num_consumers: 2
    queue_size: 10
  retry_on_failure:
    enabled: true
    initial_interval: 10s
    randomization_factor: 0.7
    multiplier: 1.3
    max_interval: 60s
    max_elapsed_time: 10m
  headers:
    "can you have a . here?": "F0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    header1: 234
    another: "somevalue"
  compression: gzip

Configure gzip compression
--------------------------------

By default, gzip compression is enabled. To turn it off, use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml


  exporters:
    otlphttp:
      ...
      compression: none
