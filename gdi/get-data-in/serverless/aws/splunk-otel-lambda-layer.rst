   :description: Learn how to instrument your AWS Lambda functions to export spans and metrics to Splunk Observability Cloud. The layer supports numerous programming languages through integrated wrappers, and includes a metrics extension that collects high-resolution, low-latency metrics on function execution.

Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Lambda layer to automatically instrument AWS Lambda functions to send application metrics and traces to Splunk APM. The layer supports numerous programming languages through integrated wrappers, and includes a metrics extension that collects high-resolution, low-latency metrics every time the function runs.

To instrument your AWS Lambda function using the Splunk OpenTelemetry Lambda layer, select the deployment mode that best adapts to your needs.

    * - Deployment mode
      - When to use

    * - :ref:`All-in-one (default) <instrument-aws-lambda-functions>`
      - All components are in a single layer, including the Collector. This is the most comprehensive deployment method and is suited for production environments.

    * - :ref:`Separate layers <instrument-aws-lambda-functions-modular>`
      - Use separate layers for your language or runtime, Collector, and metric extension. This method reduces performance overhead.

    * - :ref:`Separate layers with EC2 gateway <instrument-aws-lambda-functions-ec2>`
      - Use a layer for your language or runtime and configure the Collector in data forwarding mode in EC2. This is the instrumentation method that uses the least resources, though it requires more configuration.
