To instrument your .NET application, follow these steps:

#. Check compatibility and requirements. See :ref:`dotnet-requirements`.
#. Instrument your .NET application. See :ref:`instrument-dotnet-applications`.
#. Configure your instrumentation. See :ref:`advanced-dotnet-configuration`.

You can also automatically instrument your .NET applications along with the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector installation. Zero-code instrumentation removes the need to install and configure the .NET library separately. See :ref:`windows-backend-auto-discovery` for the installation instructions.
