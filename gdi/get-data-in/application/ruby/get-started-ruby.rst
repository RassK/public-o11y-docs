You can send application traces and metrics from your Ruby applications to Splunk Observability Cloud using the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Ruby.

To instrument your Ruby application, follow these steps: 

#. Check compatibility and requirements. See :ref:`ruby-otel-requirements`.
#. Instrument your Ruby application. See :ref:`instrument-ruby-applications`.

.. note:: The Splunk Distribution for OpenTelemetry Ruby has been deprecated as of March 15, 2024, and will reach end of support on March 15, 2025. See :ref:`get-started-ruby` to use the upstream OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Ruby.
