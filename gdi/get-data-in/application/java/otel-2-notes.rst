OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation, which is used by the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java, released its 2.0 version, which includes breaking changes that affect the ingest of Java metrics in Splunk Observability Cloud.

The 2.0 release of the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java, expected to happen in early 2024, will be fully compatible with the changes introduced by OpenTelemetry. A migration guide will be available for existing users.

Until the release of the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java 2.0 happens, existing and new user must continue using version 1.x, which is fully supported and functional.

.. caution:: Splunk supports only upstream OTel components as part of the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java. Usage of upstream OpenTelemetry Java 2.0 is discouraged and support is provided on a best-effort basis only.
