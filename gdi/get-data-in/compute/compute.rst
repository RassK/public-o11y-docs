Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector on your infrastructure to start sending data to Splunk Observability Cloud. For an overview of the Collector, see :ref:`otel-intro`.

See the following topics to set up the Collector on each of these hosts:

Use the Collector to send your infrastructure metrics and logs to Splunk Observability Cloud: 

* To send custom metrics, see :ref:`send-custom-metrics`. 

* To send logs, see :ref:`otel-understand-use`.

  * For Kubernetes, native OpenTelemetry log collection is supported by default. 

  * For Linux and Windows environments, use the Universal Forwarder to send logs to the Splunk platform. 

.. note:: To learn more about the data model of Splunk Observability Cloud, see :ref:`data-model`.
