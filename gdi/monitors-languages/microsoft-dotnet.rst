Microsoft .NET (deprecated)
===========================

.. meta::
   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the .NET (dotnet) apps monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics

.. note:: This integration is deprecated and will be removed in February 2025. To forward data to Splunk Observability Cloud, use the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET. For a full list of collected metrics, refer to :ref:`dotnet-otel-metrics-attributes`. 

The :ref:`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>`
uses the :ref:`Smart Agent receiver <smartagent-receiver>` with the
``dotnet`` monitor type to report metrics for .NET applications.

This integration is only available on Windows.

This integration reports the instantaneous values for Windows
Performance Counters. Most of these performance counters are gauges that
represent rates per second and percentages. This means that in a
collection interval, spikes might occur on the Performance Counters. The
best way to mitigate this limitation is to increase the reporting
interval on this monitor to collect more frequently.

The following is a list of the most critical .NET performance counters:

-  Exceptions

-  Logical threads

-  Physical threads

-  Heap bytes

-  Time in GC

-  Committed bytes

-  Pinned objects

Example
~~~~~~~

To activate this integration, add the following to your Collector
configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/dotnet:
       type: dotnet
       ...  # Additional config

Next, add the monitor to the ``service.pipelines.metrics.receivers``
section of your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   service:
    pipelines:
      metrics:
        receivers: [smartagent/dotnet]

      - Description
   - 

      - ``counterRefreshInterval``
      - no
      - ``int64``
      - Number of seconds that wildcards in counter paths should be
         expanded and how often to refresh counters from configuration.
         (**default:** ``60s``)
   - 

      - ``printValid``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - Print out the configurations that match available performance
         counters. This option is used for debugging. (**default:**
         ``false``)

Metrics
-------

This integration emits all metrics by default, but they are categorized
as custom metrics. See the notes for more details.
