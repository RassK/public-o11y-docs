   :description: Use the Android or iOS demo application to explore Splunk RUM for Mobile. Learn how to access the Splunk RUM for Mobile applications on Github. 

There are two demo applications for you to explore for RUM for Mobile.  

Android demo app 
===================

The splunk-otel-android library includes a demo application called sample-app that you can use to test the RUM product. To build and run the sample application, you need to configure a :code:`local.properties` file in the root of the project. To learn more about realms, see :ref:`Note about realms <about-realms>`.

To access the sample app, see the :new-page:`sample-app <https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-android/tree/main/sample-app>` in the splunk-otel-android project on GitHub.  

To use the sample app, configure the following two properties in the :code:`local.properties file`. The Splunk RUM access token needs to be for the realm you selected. 

.. code-block:: java

    rum.realm=<realm>
    rum.access.token=<Splunk RUM access token>

iOS demo app 
===================

The splunk-otel-ios library includes a demo application called Demo Boutique. 

To access the sample app, see :new-page:`Demo Boutique <https://github.com/signalfx/tracing-examples/tree/main/ios/Demo%20Boutique>` in tracing-examples/iOS on GitHub. 

To use the demo app, open :code:`Demo Boutique.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the Demo Boutique application.
