   :description: Some APIs, and parts of the data model in iOS and Android instrumentation libraries for Splunk RUM have been deprecated.

Certain APIs and data model attributes in the iOS and Android instrumentation libraries have been deprecated or changed in Splunk RUM. As of January 30, 2025 there are no breaking changes at this time, but support for deprecated APIs and data model attributes will be removed in a future release.


What deprecation means
=================================================================

Deprecated iOS and Android instrumentation APIs and data model attributes continue to work until Splunk RUM stops supporting them. You need to begin planning for the future removal of their support.


What removal means
=================================================================

When Splunk RUM removes support for these iOS and Android instrumentation APIs and data model attributes it means that they no longer work with Splunk RUM and you must find an alternative.
