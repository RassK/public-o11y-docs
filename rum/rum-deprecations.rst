Deprecation notice for iOS and Android instrumentation APIs
*****************************************************************

.. meta::
   :description: PLACEHOLDER.

Certain APIs and data model attributes in the iOS and Android instrumentation libraries have been deprecated or changed in Splunk RUM. For iOS, breaking changes were released on <date>. For Android, there are no breaking changes at this time, but support for deprecated APIs and data model attributes will be removed in a future release.


What deprecation means
=================================================================

Deprecated iOS and Android instrumentation APIs and data model attributes continue to work and Splunk supports them until support is removed. However, you need to begin planning now for the future removal of support.


What removal means
=================================================================

When Splunk removes support for these iOS and Android instrumentation APIs and data model attributes it means that they no longer work with Splunk RUM and you must find an alternative.
