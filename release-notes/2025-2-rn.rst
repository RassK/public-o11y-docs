   * - New feature or enhancement
     - Description
   * - AI Assistant in Splunk Observability Cloud (Available in select US and EU regions)
     - Use natural language to interact with your observability data in the AI Assistant and extract insights from Splunk Observability Cloud. Available in AWS US East Virginia (us-east-1), AWS US West Oregon (us-west-2), AWS EU Dublin (eu-west-1) and AWS AP Sydney (ap-southeast-2).
   * - Datalinks for Splunk AppDynamics Tiers in Splunk Observability Cloud
     - Use Datalink for AppDynamics Tiers, a new type in Global Datalinks, to connect your Splunk Observability Cloud and AppDynamics environments. Jump from inferred services in your service map to the corresponding tiers in AppDynamics. Administrators can configure and manage datalinks, so all users benefit from simplified workflows and unified visibility. For large-scale deployments, administrators can use a provided Terraform script to automate the bulk creation of AppDynamics Tier datalinks.
   * - Kubernetes proactive troubleshooting journey
     - Use new faceted filters to improve search capabilities. Use enhanced metrics categorization for deeper troubleshooting. View entity status icons and metrics as fraction that align with Kubernetes nomenclature. 
     
       For more information, see :ref:`infrastructure-k8s-nav`.
   * - Splunk Synthetic Monitoring private location enhancements
     - * Deploy Splunk Synthetics private locations on additional environments, including Kubernetes, OpenShift, and ARM 64 architectures. This gives you the freedom to deploy in the trusted environments of your choice, offering more flexibility in how you deploy and maintain your monitoring infrastructure.
       *  Use Splunk Synthetic Monitoring private location deployment with Helm charts to deploy and maintain your synthetic monitoring more efficiently.
       * In this release, we've fixed a large number of security vulnerabilities, making the Splunk Synthetics private location image more secure and safer to deploy. We're committed to keeping your monitoring environment safe while maintaining performance and reliability.
   * - Muting rules creation and list view updates
     - Use the enhanced user experience for creating and managing muting rules in Splunk Observability Cloud to reduce alert noise and silence notifications during maintenance windows and other expected high-alert periods. Mute multiple detectors and properties with one rule, set relative or absolute muting time windows, and view affected active alerts. View expired muting rules, clear active rules, and filter rules by status from the updated list view.

       For more information, see :ref:`mute-notifications`.
   * - Discovered services in Data Management
     - Use the new discovered services tab to track which third-party applications, such as databases or web servers, your Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector instance has detected running in your environment. Follow the steps in the data management interface to add credentials and other necessary information to monitor these services.
   * - Related Content for logs in APM
     - Get more control over your log consumption with the option to include logs in Related Content in APM. Admins can use this option to control whether logs are searched when their users run a Related Content search in APM.

       For more information, see :ref:`related-logs-in-apm`.

   * - Splunk Observability Cloud instrumentation updates: Node.js version 3.0.0 and Python version 2.0.0 
     - New versions of the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry JS and Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Python are available. 

       For more information, see :ref:`get-started-nodejs-3x` and :ref:`get-started-python`.
