  :description: Archive logs in Amazon S3 buckets using infinite logging rules. Reduce the amount of logs data you index. Increase logs' retention period.


Create infinite logging rules to archive all or any subset of logs in Amazon S3 buckets for compliance or possible future use while not paying to index them unless and until you want to analyze them in Splunk Log Observer. 

Only customers with a Splunk Log Observer entitlement can use infinite logging rules. Those customers must transition to Log Observer Connect.

After the transition to Log Observer Connect
=============================================================================
You can continue using existing infinite logging rules. You can turn your existing infinite logging rules off and on. However, you cannot create new infinite logging rules or edit existing rules.

Going forward, determine the best option for your organization by discussing with your Splunk representative the following types of data storage you can use in the Splunk platform instead of infinite logging rules:

Use cases for archiving your logs
=============================================================================
There are two primary use cases to archive your logs:

- :ref:`To reduce the amount of data you index <logs-reduce>`

- :ref:`To retain logs data longer than 30 days <logs-retain>`

.. _logs-reduce:

Reduce the amount of data you indexed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some logs may not be useful on a day-to-day basis but may still be important in case of a future incident. For example, you might not always want to index logs from a non-production environment, or index every debug message. In either case, you can create an infinite logging rule to archive those logs in S3 buckets that your team owns in AWS. 

If you want to keep a sample of your archived logs to analyze in Log Observer, you can set the sampling rate in your infinite logging rule so that some amount of the data you archive will also be indexed. You pay for only the logs that you index and analyze in Log Observer. This way, you can monitor trends across all your logs while reducing the impact on your indexing capacity. See :ref:`order-of-execution` in the next section to learn more about using pipeline rules to help reduce your indexing capacity.

.. _logs-retain:

Retain logs longer than 30 days
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Storing logs in S3 buckets gives you full control over retention time, which can, for example, help you meet compliance and audit requirements. To retain logs longer than Log Observer's 30-day retention period, you can archive and index 100% of your logs. Logs that are archived and indexed will be available for analysis in Log Observer for 30 days and will also be stored in S3 buckets for as long as you want them.

.. _order-of-execution:

Order of execution of logs pipeline rules
=============================================================================
Logs pipeline rules execute in the following order:

1. All log processing rules (field extraction, field copy, and field redaction processors)

2. All log metricization rules

3. All infinite logging rules

Because infinite logging rules run last, you can create field extraction rules, then use the resulting fields in infinite logging rules. You can also metricize logs, then archive them through infinite logging without impacting your ingest capacity. For more information, see :ref:`logs-pipeline-sequence`.

Prerequisites
================================================================================
To create new infinite logging S3 connections, You must have an administrator role in Splunk Observability Cloud. If you have a power user role, you can send data to S3 buckets using an existing infinite logging S3 connection, but you cannot create new S3 connections. See AWS documentation for permissions required to create S3 buckets in the AWS Management Console. 

If you have a read_only or usage role, you cannot create new S3 connections or use existing connections to send data to S3 buckets.

Create an infinite logging rule
================================================================================

To create an infinite logging rule, follow these steps:

1. From the navigation menu, go to :guilabel:`Data Configuration > Logs Pipeline Management`.

2. Click :guilabel:`New infinite logging Rule`.

3. Decide where to archive your data. To send your logs to an existing S3 bucket, select the infinite logging connection you want, then skip to step 9.

4. If you want to send your data to a new S3 bucket and you are a Splunk Observability Cloud admin, select :guilabel:`Create new connection`. The :guilabel:`Establish a New S3 Connection` guided setup appears.

5. On the :guilabel:`Choose an AWS Region and Authentication Type` tab, do the following:

   a. Select the AWS region you want to connect to. 
   b. Select whether you want to use the :guilabel:`External ID` or :guilabel:`Security Token` authentication type.
   c. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
   
6. On the :guilabel:`Prepare AWS Account` tab, follow the steps in the guided setup to do the following in the AWS Management Console:

   a. Create an AWS policy. The guided setup provides the exact policy you must copy and paste into AWS.
   b. Create a role and associate it with the AWS policy.
   c. Create and configure an S3 bucket.

7. On the :guilabel:`Establish Connection` tab, do the following:

   a. Give your new S3 connection a name.
   b. Paste the Role ARN from the AWS Management Console into the :guilabel:`Role ARN` field in the guided setup.
   c. Give your S3 bucket a name.
   d. Select :guilabel:`Save`.

8. Select the Amazon S3 infinite logging connection that you created on the first page of the guided setup. Your data goes to your S3 bucket in a file that you configure in the following two steps.

9. (Optional) You can add a file prefix, which prepend to the front of the file you send to your S3 bucket.

10. (Optional) In :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration Options`, you can select the compression and file formats of the file you will send to your S3 bucket. 

11. Select :guilabel:`Next`.

12. On the :strong:`Filter Data` page, create a filter that matches the log lines you want to archive in your S3 bucket. Only logs matching the filter are archived. If you want to index a sample of the logs going to the archive, select a percentage in :guilabel:`Define indexing behavior`. Indexing a small percentage of logs in Log Observer lets you see trends in logs that are in S3 buckets. Select :guilabel:`Next`.

13. Add a name and description for your infinite logging rule.

14. Review your configuration choices, then select :guilabel:`Save`.

Your infinite logging setup is now complete. Depending on your selections, your logs are archived, indexed in Splunk Observability Cloud for analysis, or both.

Infinite logging rules limits
================================================================================
An organization can create a total of 128 infinite logging rules.
