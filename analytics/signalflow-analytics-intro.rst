:new-page:`SignalFlow <https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/signalflow/>` is the analytics engine at the heart of Splunk Observability Cloud. It runs computation that allow you to analyze incoming data and write custom chart and detector analytics.

You can use the following SignalFlow components to create custom analytics for your data:

- SignalFlow programming language: A Python-like language that you use to write SignalFlow programs.
- SignalFlow library: Functions and methods you can call from a SignalFlow program.
- SignalFlow computation engine: The engine that runs your SignalFlow programs in the background and streams results.

To learn how to use SignalFlow, see :ref:`get-started-signalflow`.
