      :description: Use built-in, custom, or user dashboard and dashboard group types to understand your data in Splunk Observability Cloud. Custom and user dashboards and dashboard groups are accessible by all users. 

Dashboards are groupings of charts and visualizations of metrics. All dashboards, irrespective of type, belong to a dashboard group. Dashboard groups appear on the :strong:`Dashboards` page.

For more information about accessing dashboards and dashboard groups, see :ref:`viewing-dashboards`.

Splunk Observability Cloud provides three types of dashboards and dashboard groups that you can use to understand your data:

* Built-in

* Custom

* User

All custom and user dashboards and dashboard groups are accessible by all users in your organization.


.. _built-in:

Built-in dashboards and dashboard groups
===========================================

Splunk Observability Cloud creates built-in dashboard groups when you add a data-monitoring integration. The dashboards in these groups are automatically created for you when you use integrations that send metrics that Splunk Observability Cloud recognizes. Built-in dashboard groups give you immediate visibility into the technologies and services used in your environment.

Built-in dashboards behave like templates. To use them in any way beyond simple viewing, for example to add or modify charts, you must first save a copy of the dashboard by following these steps:

#. Select the :strong:`Dashboard actions` menu.
#. Select :strong:`Save as`.

For more information about built-in dashboards, see :ref:`built-in-dashboards`. For the full list of available built-in dashboards, see :ref:`dashboards-list-imm`.


Custom dashboards and dashboard groups
=========================================

Custom dashboard groups and custom dashboards are ones that aren't automatically generated by Splunk Observability Cloud. For example, when you create a new dashboard group, you are creating a custom dashboard group.

Multiple users can work on a custom dashboard to represent a curated set of charts that they want to make accessible to a broad cross-section of the organization. Custom dashboards are typically organized by service, team, or environment.

For more information about creating dashboard groups and dashboards, see :ref:`create-dashboard`.


.. _user-dashboard-group:

User dashboards and dashboard groups
=======================================

Every Splunk Observability Cloud user who has set a password and logged in at least once gets a user dashboard group and user dashboard. Your user dashboard group is your individual workspace within Splunk Observability Cloud. Depending on when you create your account, your user dashboard group might contain a large number of demo data dashboards.

The names of your user dashboard group and user dashboard are the email address associated with your Splunk Observability Cloud account.

To access your user dashboard group, in the navigation menu, select :strong:`Dashboards`. At the top of the :strong:`Dashboards` page, you can see your favorite dashboards, recently accessed dashboards, and your user dashboard in your user dashboard group.
