When you set up a test in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring, you can configure the viewport and network connection of the device from which the test is simulated. 

Because browser tests capture the visual experience of a page, while uptime and API tests only capture response data, viewport settings apply to browser tests only. Network connection settings apply to all test types. 


Viewport
===================================
Browser tests capture the visual experience of a user interacting with your application. The viewport is the framed area on a device's screen for viewing information, such as the browser window on a desktop. By default, browser tests run from a desktop-sized viewport, but in the test creation view you can select a different device type to test the user experience from a different viewport size. 
 

Network connection
===================================
You can run browser, uptime, or API tests to simulate network connections of various latencies, including Mobile LTE, Mobile 3G, DSL, Mobile 5G, and cable internet. Testing your site from a variety of connection types lets you monitor the experience of users in a variety of settings.
