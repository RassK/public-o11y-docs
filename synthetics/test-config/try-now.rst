    :description: Use a try now run in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring to validate tests and check that your test configurations are correct and accurate. 

When you create a test, you have the option to validate the configuration of your test with a try now run. 

When to run a test or use try now to validate your test configuration 
========================================================================
There are two types of runs in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring try now runs, and persisted runs. A persisted run executes on a schedule and run results are stored, and used for monitoring. Persisted runs are a result of any type of Browser, API, or Uptime test that runs on a schedule.  A try now run executes immediately and run results aren't stored. Try now runs are used to validate a test. Here is some guidance on when to use each type of run.
