RUM subscription and usage metrics 
***************************************************************************

.. note:: The following information describes aspects of your usage and consumption. For more detailed billing-related queries, contact your Splunk Account Team.

View subscription usage 
==========================================

There are two types of subscriptions: enterprise and standard. For more information on each type of subscription, see :new-page:`Splunk RUM Pricing <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/pricing/faqs/observability.html#splunk-rum>`.


Splunk RUM offers three metrics you can use to track your subscription usage. You can use these metrics to create charts, dashboards, and set alerts. Usage data is based on a monthly cadence. To see how your usage compares to limits, see :ref:`rum-limits`.

Each metric has two dimensions:

* ``app``: The application where the data came from.
*  ``sf_product``: The type of product, either web or mobile device that the data came from.
