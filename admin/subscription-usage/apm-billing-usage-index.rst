.. _host-diagnostics-report-apm:

Download a host and container diagnostic report
==============================================================

For host subscription plans, you can download reports that show which hosts and containers are sending APM data over a specific minute. Use this report to identify which hosts and containers are contributing to your subscription usage. You can generate and download reports within the retention period for traces. See :ref:`apm-data-retention` for more information.

To download a subscription usage report, do the following steps:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Settings` then :menuselection:`Subscription Usage`.
#. Select the :guilabel:`APM` tab.
#. Expand the :guilabel:`Hosts` chart or the :guilabel:`Containers` chart.
#. Select an hour of time in the chart within the retention period for traces.
#. Select a specific minute within the hour.
#. If you've selected a minute that falls within the trace retention period, the :guilabel:`Download Data` becomes active and displays the minute you selected. Select the download button to download  the .csv file.

The following GIF shows the steps to download a subscription usage report.

    :alt: Animated image that shows Selecting a minute within the hosts chart to download a diagnostic report.

For each selected minute, the report shows the attributes or tags associated with the hosts and containers that sent data to Splunk APM. You might see different tags, like ``AWSUniqueId``, ``container_id``,  ``gcp_id``, and so on, depending on the source of the host or container observed and the version of your instrumentation agent.

.. caution:: For Kubernetes deployments, the Kubernetes attributes processor extracts default attributes, such as ``k8s.pod.name``. These attributes are required for accurate subscription usage. Don't remove the Kubernetes attributes processor from your configuration. See :ref:`kubernetes-attributes-processor` for more information.

.. _trace-span-statistics:

Use the trace and span statistics to understand increases in usage
=====================================================================

Use :guilabel:`Usage Analyzer` at the bottom of the page to understand increases in your usage data. Specifically, the usage analyzer can help you determine your most expensive services, your most-used tag values, and your largest ingested traces.

The :guilabel:`Spans per minute` and :guilabel:`Trace volume` charts show span and trace volume ingested at 2-hour intervals for the last 8 days. Select a 2-hour bar within either chart to see data tables for :guilabel:`Services by span count`, :guilabel:`Tags by total size`, and :guilabel:`Traces with most spans` for the midpoint minute within the 2-hour interval.

Use this data to troubleshoot and create a plan to mitigate sudden increases in your APM usage data.

.. _apm-throttling-entitlement:

Use the APM throttling and entitlement dashboards to better understand your usage
===================================================================================

#. Select :guilabel:`Dashboards`.
#. Search for "APM entitlements" or "APM throttling" to access the :guilabel:`APM entitlements` and :guilabel:`APM throttling` dashboards to further examine your usage. 

The APM entitlements dashboard provides historical data for metrics used on the :guilabel:`Subscription Usage` page. 

The following image shows the APM entitlements dashboard.

The APM throttling dashboard includes metrics that track throttling and limits in your organization. Several metrics in the APM throttling dashboard have detectors set up to send alerts when metrics for your organization are being throttled. 

The following image shows the APM throttling dashboard.

How APM calculates usage
========================

APM uses Splunk Observability Cloud metrics to calculate usage for traces-analyzed-per-minute (TAPM) and host subscription plans. Limits for host subscription plans are based on the number of hosts and containers sending data to APM. Limits for TAPM subscription plans are based on the number of traces you send to APM per minute.

APM provides a value for each usage metric the system collects for each subscription usage period. Use the charts on the APM Subscription Usage page that plot these metrics so you can monitor the billed value for each metric.

See the following sections for more information about how APM calculates usage for each subscription plan type. To confirm the plan for your organization, view the :guilabel:`Subscription` panel on the Subscription Usage page.

The following sections detail the metrics for TAPM and host subscription plans respectively.
