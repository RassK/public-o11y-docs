   onboarding-readiness


The onboarding journey for Splunk Observability Cloud has 3 phases: onboarding readiness, initial rollout, and scaled rollout. In the onboarding readiness phase you set up users, teams, and access controls using roles and token management. In the initial rollout phase you get your data into Splunk Observability Cloud and set up the Splunk Observability Cloud solutions that apply to your organization. Solutions include: Infrastructure Monitoring, Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Real User Monitoring (RUM), and Synthetics. In the final, scaled rollout phase you establish repeatable observability practices using automation, data management, detectors, and dashboards.
