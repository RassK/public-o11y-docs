    :description: Learn how to install the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes and get Kubernetes data into Splunk Observability Cloud. 

Install the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector in a Kubernetes cluster to start getting platform infrastructure data into Splunk Observability Cloud.
After this data starts flowing into Splunk Observability Cloud, you can take these actions:

* Monitor your platform infrastructure data using navigators.
* Activate a built-in detector to issue alerts about specific conditions in your data.

.. note::
    
    To ensure a seamless flow from this task to :ref:`monitor-k8s-cluster`, make sure that your infrastructure host or cluster is generating data that Splunk Observability Cloud can receive. 
    For example, even if a guided setup you use in this task provides a confirmation of a valid connection, the navigators don't appear unless your infrastructure is actively sending data to Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring.

Get Kubernetes data into Splunk Observability Cloud
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Log in to Splunk Observability Cloud.
2. Select the :guilabel:`Add Integration` button or in the left navigation menu, select :guilabel:`Data Management` to open the :strong:`Integrate Your Data` page.
3. Select :guilabel:`Deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector`, and select :guilabel:`Next`. The Install Configuration screen displays.
4. In the :guilabel:`Platform` menu, select :guilabel:`Kubernetes`. The setup guide opens.

5. Enter the values applicable to your environment to configure the Collector instance.
