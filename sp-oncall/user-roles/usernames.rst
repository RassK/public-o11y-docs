   :description: Recommended practices for creating Splunk On-Call user names.

When inviting new users to the Splunk On-Call platform, it is important to consider the following:

-  Each user is responsible for setting up their own username at the time of registration.
-  Usernames cannot be changed.
-  Splunk On-Call does not enforce naming conventions, so it is your responsibility as an administrator to choose and enforce a naming convention.
-  Usernames are global, not unique to your organization. If a username that fits your naming convention is not available, consider appending the username with your organization name. For example, john.smith is taken, but john.smith.BobsITshop is probably available. Putting the organization name at the end ensures that users in Splunk On-Call can still use the auto-drop-down lists when they begin typing another user's username when using the chat function.

After being invited, users will receive the an email listing the organization's name and who sent the invitation. The invited individual
will have 48 hours to sign up, before the Activate Account link expires.

Usernames should be recognizable to everyone in your organization. We find these naming conventions work best:

-  First name - last name (johnsmith, john.smith)
-  First initial last name (jsmith, j.smith)
-  Match your email naming convention
-  If the username is taken, try appending a number to the end

If you are using Slack, you will want to match your Splunk On-Call usernames to your chat usernames.

Recover Username
===================

If you forget your username, select Forgot username? on the login page to start the username recovery process. In the subsequent screen,
you'll enter the email address associated with your Splunk On-Call account. In your email client, you'll receive a message showing your
Splunk On-Call username. Directly from the email, select the Log in button to return to the sign-on page where you can now enter
your credentials.

.. note:: Your username is not your email, it is the username you or your organization created when the account was initially configured.
