Username Best Practice
------------------------------

When inviting new users to the Splunk On-Call platform, it is important to consider the following:

-  Each user is responsible for setting up their own username at the time of registration.
-  Usernames cannot be changed.
-  Splunk On-Call does not enforce naming conventions, so it is your responsibility as an administrator to choose and enforce a naming convention.
-  Usernames are global, not unique to your organization. If a username that fits your naming convention is not available, consider appending the username with your organization name. For example, if john.smith is taken, try john.smith.bobsITshop is probably available. Putting the organization name at the end ensures that users in Splunk On-Call can still use the auto-drop-down lists when they begin typing another user's username when using the chat function.

You want to make a username that is recognizable to everyone in your organization. We find these naming conventions to work best:

-  First name - last name (johnsmith, john.smith)
-  First initial last name (jsmith, j.smith)
-  Match your email naming convention

.. Note:: If you are using HipChat or Slack, you will want to match your Splunk On-Call usernames to your chat usernames.

Complete your Profile
============================

Once you have successfully created a username and password, Splunk On-Call will take you to the main timeline of the
org. Select your username in the top right-hand corner of the screen, then :guilabel:`Your Profile` to complete your set up.

If you add a cell phone number, you will need to verify the number. Select :guilabel:`Verify`, to the right of the phone number you added, and we will send a four digit SMS short code that you must enter into your
profile.

If you're adding a landline or a desk phone, enter the desired phone number and email support@victorops.com. Splunk On-Call Support will manually verify your phone number.


Set up your Paging Policy
==================================

Located shortly below your contact methods is the :guilabel:`Paging Policy` section. This is how Splunk On-Call  notifies you if an incident comes in when you are on-call. Build out your Paging Policy to ensure that you are properly notified when an incident comes in. You have the option to add additional steps within steps, by using the plus (+) button, or you can add additional steps by selecting :guilabel:`Add a Step`.
