Make sure to add the appropriate routing key to your endpoint URL. See :ref:`spoc-routing-keys`.

Panopta configuration
=====================================

1. From the Alerting menu in the control panel, select the :guilabel:`Integrations` tab.

2. Select the webhooks integration.

3. Name the integration. Under the :guilabel:`Incident Webhook` tab, set the request method to POST, and the postback URL as the Splunk On-Call REST endpoint URL from the previous step.

4. Select a raw payload as your payload type, then copy the following JSON snippet in the code box:

```json
{"message_type":"CRITICAL","entity_id":"$name", "state_message":"$items - $reasons","monitoring_tool":"Panopta"}
```

To also send a recovery message to Splunk On-Call, create a second webhook under the :guilabel:`Clear Webhook` tab. Give it a name, like Splunk On-Call Recovery. Select POST as your request method, and paste in your Splunk On-Call REST
endpoint URL for the Postback URL.

```json
{"message_type":"RECOVERY","entity_id":"$name", "state_message":"$items - $reasons","monitoring_tool":"Panopta"}
```
