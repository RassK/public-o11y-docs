Uptime Robot integration for Splunk On-Call
**********************************************************

Every 5 minutes, Uptime Robot can check up to fifty monitors to determine website downtime and performance. In addition to monitoring uptime, downtime and website response times, Uptime Robot offers the ability to create public status pages. Integrated with VictorOps, Uptime Robot gives you the capability to seamlessly notify both internal and external stakeholders to application performance issues and downtime.

Set monitors and thresholds in Uptime Robot and manage associated on-call rotations and calendars, alert rules, and escalation policies in VictorOps. Build visibility into website performance and automate critical on-call processes to create efficient incident response workflows and make on-call suck less

Spend less time worrying about website performance or downtime. The VictorOps and Uptime Robot integration creates a holistic system for website monitoring, incident detection, on-call response and remediation.
