About VictorOps and GitHub
--------------------------

VictorOps's delivery insights endpoint integration
with `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ ensures better visibility into
development, delivery, and issues in production. You can send
pull request information from GitHub repositories directly into the
VictorOps timeline where your team can collaborate further. Leverage the
power of GitHub data with the actionable alerting and collaborative
features (i.e. Rules Engine, annotations, and chat) of VictorOps.

VictorOps, with the integrated respository information pulled from
GitHub, improves collaboration when working through the full SDLC.
Detailed context into production issues and better communication leads
to continuous delivery and more effective incident management.

**Improved Visibility and Collaboration Leads to Continuous Delivery**

-  Delivery Insights functionality lets you more closely monitor the
   SDLC in real-time with GitHub repository data contextually displayed
   in the VictorOps timeline
-  Collaborate cross-functionally around software delivery, develop and
   resolve incidents quickly with a deep knowledge of recent changes in
   production, and communicate around contextual alerts
-  Work and communicate seamlessly through both VictorOps and GitHub to
   influence rapid development and incident remediation

The VictorOps / GitHub Application integration allows you to send
important **pull request** information directly into the timeline from
the repositories of your choice. The following is a quick guide showing
