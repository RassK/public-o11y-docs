DNS Check enables you to easily monitor, share and troubleshoot DNS
records. The DNSCheck.co integration can create and resolve incidents in
Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps) based on the results of DNS record
checks, giving DNS Check users greater visibility and awareness of DNS
related issues so they can resolve problems faster.

Incidents will be created automatically based on the alerting
configuration in DNS Check. Issues resolved in Splunk On-Call will be
automatically resolved in DNS Check.

--------------

**In Splunk On-Call:**
