**Sumo Logic** is the industry’s leading, secure and purpose-built
cloud-based machine data analytics service that leverages big data for
real-time IT insights.

This integration utilizes Sumo Logic’s “Connections” option to send
webhooks to the VictorOps REST endpoint, creating incidents in the
timeline. The following guide will walk you through the steps needed to
integrate the two platforms.

**In VictorOps**
----------------

In VictorOps, select *Integrations.* If the integration has not yet been
enabled, click the “Enable Integration” button to generate your endpoint
URL. Copy this URL for use in the Sumo Logic portion of integration
configuration. Be sure to replace the “$routing_key” section with the
actual routing key you intend to use.

**In Sumo Logic**
-----------------

From the main dashboard select **Manage** then **Connections.**

Give the Connection a name and description. Paste in the URL you got
from the VictorOps portal. No Authorization Header is needed. Finally
copy the JSON payload below and paste it into the “Payload” box.

*NOTE: Depending on your scheduled search settings you may want to use*
**:math:`SearchQuery** for the "state\_message" field in place of **`\ SearchDescription**

{“message_type”:“CRITICAL”,

“entity_id”:“{{SearchName}}”,

“state_message”:“{{SearchQuery}}”,

“Search Description”:“{{SearchDescription}}”,

“Search Name”:“{{SearchName}}”,

“Number of Raw Results”:“{{NumRawResults}}”

}

Make sure to test the connection and make sure you get a 200 response
code.

Lastly you will need to add the VictorOps “connection” to one of your
scheduled searches. To do this, select **Library** and then choose one
of your searches.
