About Splunk On-Call and Grafana
--------------------------------

The Splunk On-Call and Grafana integration allows you to forward
`Grafana <https://grafana.com/>`__ alerts and dashboards into Splunk
On-Call to notify the correct on-call users. Create on-call schedules,
rotations, and escalation policies in Splunk On-Call, then route Grafana
alerts and charts based on those parameters. Monitor and visualize logs,
metrics and traces in Grafana and set thresholds to optimize alerts,
create charts and surface actionable system insights.

When events meet predetermined monitoring criteria, Grafana sends an
alert notification. Then, in the Splunk On-Call timeline, users can
route and escalate critical alert data to the correct people. With the
Splunk On-Call and Grafana integration, on-call responders can
collaborate in real-time around system data to reduce MTTA/MTTR and
resolve incidents faster.

**Optimize Alerts and Incident Visibility throughout the Entire
Organization**

-  Track system performance over time, visualize service health and
   alert on-call teams when applicable monitoring thresholds are met
-  Surface alert context in the form of metrics, logs, graphs and links
   to runbooks
-  Automatically route and escalate Grafana alert data through Splunk
   On-Call software and collaborate in a single-pane-of-glass to drive
   incident workflows forward
-  Chat in-line with incident context to improve collaboration and
   quickly share critical infrastructure information and dashboards,
   reducing MTTA/MTTR

Grafana is a general purpose dashboard and graph composer. It’s focused
on providing rich ways to visualize time series metrics from Graphite,
but also works with several other popular metric databases like
InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, and Prometheus. The Grafana and Splunk On-Call
integration allows you to understand your alerts and metrics so you get
the most out of your data. The following guide will walk you through
this easy to implement integration.

**Enable Grafana in Splunk On-Call**
------------------------------------

From the main timeline navigate to *Integrations >> Grafana*

Select the **Grafana** integration and copy the **Service API
Endpoint** to your clipboard.

**Connect Splunk On-Call in Grafana**
-------------------------------------

From the main dashboard, select the options menu then **Alerting** then
**Notification Channels**.

Give the notification a name select the **VictorOps** type. In the
VictorOps settings paste in your **Service API Endpoint** from your
clipboard. Be sure to replace the “$routing_key” section with the actual
routing key you intend to use. (For more information on setting up
routing keys, see our `Knowledge Base article on
Routing Keys <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/routing-keys/>`__)

You can now test and save the integration.

The resulting test alert in Splunk On-Call should look similar to this:

**Connect the Notification Channel to your Alert**
--------------------------------------------------

Locate the Grafana Dashboard panel you want to send alerts to Splunk
On-Call and click on the Edit button.  This should appear by clicking on
the dropdown arrow next to the panel’s name.  Next, navigate to the
Alert section on the lefthand side.  Define your alert conditions and
then under Notifications, click the plus button to select the
notification channel you just configured.

Be sure to save your changes.  The standard configuration is now
complete.

Repeat these steps as necessary, creating separate Notification Channels
for each Routing Key you’d like utilized and assigning the Notification
Channel on each Dashboard Panel you’d like to alert you.

**Include an Image on the Alert**
---------------------------------

For those with Enterprise Splunk On-Call features, you can include the
Grafana image of the alert in the notification. When configuring the
notification channel in Grafana, select the box to **Include image**.

In Splunk On-Call, add the following Rules Engine rule that will surface
the image_url as an annotation to the incident. (Found by navigating to
*Settings >> Alert Rules Engine)*

Lastly, ensure that the image is hosted in a publicly accessible
location so that Splunk On-Call can display it.  For further
information, please reference the **Enable images in notification**
section of `this Grafana
article <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/old-alerting/notifications/#external-image-store>`__.

Your resulting Splunk On-Call incident should now include the image as
an annotation:
