With hundreds of plugins in the Update Center, Jenkins integrates with
practically every tool in the continuous integration and continuous
delivery toolchain. The VictorOps integration with Jenkins provides
real-time contextual information regarding your builds directly into the
timeline. The following guide will walk you through this
simple-to-implement integration.

**Note:** 

-  There are two Jenkins integrations. The other is `Jenkins Delivery
   Insights Integration
   Guide <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/victorops-jenkins2-integration/>`__,
   which sends you notifications in the Timeline regarding build status.

**In VictorOps**
----------------

Navigate to the Integrations page and find the REST endpoint integration
by visiting *Integrations >> REST Endpoint*

Copy the REST endpoint URL to your clipboard.

replace the “VICTOROPS_REST_ENDPOINT_URL” with the URL you copied from
VictorOps.

``curl -X POST --header 'Accept: application/json' --data '{ "entity_id": "'${BUILD_NAME}'", "message_type": "INFO", "state_message": "Jenkins Build: '${BUILD_DISPLAY_NAME}' is underway", "BUILD_ID": "'${BUILD_ID}'" }' '**VICTOROPS_REST_ENDPOINT_URL**'``

If you wish to add additional Jenkins variables please see the available
