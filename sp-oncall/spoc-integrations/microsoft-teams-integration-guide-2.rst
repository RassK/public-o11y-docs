About VictorOps and Microsoft Teams
-----------------------------------

Create incidents in VictorOps and communicate to resolve them through
Microsoft Teams. Through `Outgoing
Webhooks <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/custom-outbound-webhooks/>`__
*(an Enterprise level feature)*, VictorOps can link up with Microsoft
Teams, allowing you to work through incidents via your communication
tool of choice. VictorOps and `Microsoft
Teams <https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software>`__ work
together to provide conversations and content when you need it, where
you need it. In one place, your on-call engineers can easily collaborate
while accessing the incident management tools and information they need
to remediate site issues.

Now you can access the full VictorOps web interface right from Microsoft
Teams. Repeat these steps for all the channels you want to have access
to VictorOps incidents.

Next we will setup Microsoft Teams Webhooks to receive VictorOps
incident alerts .

Send Alerts Into Different Channels [multi-channel]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For every channel you want to receive incident alerts from VictorOps,
you will need to create a Connector. The specification of which alerts
go to which channel will be done on the VictorOps side in the next
section.

Select the channel **Setting** (three dots) then **Connectors**.

.. figure:: images/General__VictorOps____Microsoft_Teams-4.png

   Select the channel Setting (three dots) then Connectors

Search for “Incoming Webhook” and then **Add** a new one.

Connecting Microsoft Teams in VictorOps [multi-channel]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Create Rules Engine Rules [multi-channel]**

You will need to create one Rules Engine rule for each channel you want
to route specific alerts to. Each of the Webhook URLs you generated in
Microsoft Teams have a key that defines that channel.

The channel key can be found in the URL after
“/IncomingWebhook/**your_key_here**/” Here is an example using a
“Database” and “DevOps” channel.

Database Link:

https://outlook.office.com/webhook/12345abc-250a-1234-a123-a123b4c56789@12a3bc4d-1111-1a2c-1234-1ab23c456de7/IncomingWebhook/**aaaa1111111111a11a1aaa111a11aa1a1**/1ab23c45-123a-456b-ab212-1234a567890bc

Database Channel Key: **aaaa1111111111a11a1aaa111a11aa1a1**

DevOps Link:

https://outlook.office.com/webhook/12345abc-250a-1234-a123-a123b4c56789@12a3bc4d-1111-1a2c-1234-1ab23c456de7/IncomingWebhook/**b222bbbbbbb22222222bbbbb2bb222b2**/1ab23c45-123a-456b-ab212-1234a567890bc

DevOps Channel Key: **b222bbbbbbb22222222bbbbb2bb222b2**

In this example we will be using the Rules Engine to add the channel key
to the URL based on the `Routing
Key <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/routing-keys/>`__ of the
alert. To create the rule go to **Settings** then **Alert** **Rules
Engine**.

.. image:: images/NEW-Settings.png

Select **Add a Rule**\ |image1|

Set the rule to match when “routing_key” matches “database” and then set
a transformation where “team_key” matches the Channel key from Microsoft
Teams “aaaa1111111111a11a1aaa111a11aa1a1”.

.. image:: images/NEW_MT-Rules-1.png

Repeat the previous step for as many channels as you need.

.. image:: images/2-Rules.png

This will create an alert field every time the rule is matched so you
can direct specific alerts to the associated channels. Now instead of
the full URL you copied from Microsoft Teams your URLs will look like
so:

Database Link:

https://outlook.office.com/webhook/12345abc-250a-1234-a123-a123b4c56789@12a3bc4d-1111-1a2c-1234-1ab23c456de7/IncomingWebhook/**${{ALERT.team_key}}**/1ab23c45-123a-456b-ab212-1234a567890bc

DevOps Link:

https://outlook.office.com/webhook/12345abc-250a-1234-a123-a123b4c56789@12a3bc4d-1111-1a2c-1234-1ab23c456de7/IncomingWebhook/**${{ALERT.team_key}}**/1ab23c45-123a-456b-ab212-1234a567890bc

These URLs will be used in the next section that goes over the Outbound
Webhooks.

**Create Outbound Webhooks [multi-channel]**

From the main timeline select **Integrations** then **Outgoing
Webhooks** then **Add Webhook**.

.. image:: images/FINAL-Int-OW.png

Fill out the fields like so:

Event: select **Any-Incident**

Method: select **POST**

Content Type: select **application/json**

To: paste in your Microsoft Teams webhook URL with the proper **Channel
Key** fields added from the `previous step <#channel_key>`__.

Payload: Replace your account name below, and paste in the following
payload:
``{ "title": "VictorOps Alert: ${{ALERT.entity_display_name}} is ${{ALERT.message_type}}", "text": "${{ALERT.state_message}} Link if you want [here](https://portal.victorops.com/client/**YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME**#/incident/${{STATE.INCIDENT_NAME}}) or check the tab" }``
Description: Optional.

Lastly, hit **Save** and you are done.

.. image:: images/Outgoing-Webhook.png

Now whenever an incident is generated in VictorOps you will see it come
into your Microsoft Teams channel and then be able to ack and resolve it
from the Microsoft Teams - VictorOps Tab.
