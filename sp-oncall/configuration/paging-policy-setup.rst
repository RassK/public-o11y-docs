Your Primary Paging Policy is executed when an incident is routed to you
based on a team’s Escalation Policy. Learn more about `team escalation
policies <http://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/team-escalation-policy/>`__ if
you need help setting those up. Your Paging Policy is part of your
personal profile and gives you control of how, and how often you’re
contacted when incidents are routed to you.

setting up custom paging policies
`here <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/custom-paging-policies-time-based/>`__.

Getting Started With Your Primary Paging Policy
-----------------------------------------------

In the top right-hand corner of the web UI, click your *Username*
-> *Profile*.

Input Contact Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend adding a few different contact methods (i.e. phone number
and email) so you can have multiple steps in your paging policies. A
good paging policy is a diverse paging policy.

Splunk On-Call offers **Push, Phone Call, SMS,** and **Email** contact
methods.

To utilize **Phone Call** or **SMS**, you’ll first need to verify your
phone number.  From your profile, click *Add Contact Method* and supply
a label and number for your phone.  Next, click on the blue *Verify*
button.  Enter the verification code you received on your phone, then
click on the final *Verify* button to complete the verification
process.  Note that it is still necessary to add the contact method to
your *Paging Policy* before it will be used in notifications.

Configure Your Personal Paging Policy
-------------------------------------

When an incident is routed to you, either directly or via an escalation
policy that you’re on-call for, you may determine how you’re contacted.
The steps in a personal paging policy will execute in order. The last
step of the policy will repeat until the incident is acknowledged.

Your paging policies can be adjusted by clicking on your name in the
upper-righthand corner of the web UI and then selecting *Profile*.

There are two types of personal paging policies detailed below:
**Primary** and **Custom**.

Primary Paging Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your primary paging policy is your default paging policy and it is not
time-based. You can’t delete your primary paging policy. If an incident
is routed to you, Splunk On-Call will first check all of your custom
paging policies to see if any of them match the current time. If none of
the custom paging policies match the current time, then your primary
paging policy will be used to notify you.

Custom Paging Policy

For detailed information on Custom Paging Policies, please see `this
article <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/custom-paging-policies-time-based/>`__.

**Recovery Notifications**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the following box is checked under *Settings >> Alert
Configuration*

|The VictorOps Settings -> Alert Configuration page, with ‘Send a
notification when incidents resolve’ setting checked off.| You will be
notified of incidents you were paged for or took action on by what is
configured in the Recovery Notification setting in your Profile.
