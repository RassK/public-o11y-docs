Connect Splunk On-Call to the tool of your choice using our custom
outgoing webhooks. Splunk On-Calls outbound webhooks can ‘subscribe’ to
a number of different Splunk On-Call actions such as incidents or chats.
The webhook URL, method, content type, and payload are all configurable.
Splunk On-Calls ‘variables’ can be used as part of the payload so that
the information being sent to third-party systems is dynamic. The
following will walk you through setting up your first outbound webhook.

**Please note**: The Splunk On-Call Outgoing Webhooks are an Enterprise
service level feature and require `admin
credentials <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/user-types/>`__
to view and modify.

Suggested Variables
-------------------

The example variables for each “Event” will populate on the right side
of the screen. Please note: although the variables are listed as
*Available* they are, in fact, only suggestions and may be customized to
fit your needs.

Custom Headers
--------------

To add a Custom Header to your webhook select *+ Add Custom Header*
within the new webhook.

Then configure the rest of your webhook and save the webhook. (Note:
This can take up to 10 minutes for the caching to “clear”).

--------------

Request Types
-------------

Next, select the appropriate method for your webhook. The available
options are:

-  GET
-  POST
-  PUT
-  DELETE
-  PATCH

Enter the appropriate ‘Content Type’ for your webhook, application/json
for example.

Place your endpoint URL that you want to receive these notifications in
the ‘To’ field.

Splunk On-Call parses all URL’s for basic authentication, so if your
endpoint requires basic auth you can add it to the URL like so:

**http://username:password@example.com/**

or

http://username:api_key@example.com/

The last step is to construct your Payload. If you plan to use one of
the available variables as part of your payload make sure to wrap them
with ${{variable_name}}. For example, if you want to include the number
of alerts in an incident you could add the following variable:
${{STATE.ALERT_COUNT}}. Other fields specific to the incident can also
be used, for example, ${{ALERT.field_name}}.

Finally, hit *Save* and you are done.

Conditionally Fire Webhooks
---------------------------

By combining outgoing webhooks with the power of the Alert Rules Engine,
you can set up rules to have them only fire when a desired condition is
met.

To start, you’ll navigate to the Alert Rules Engine under *Settings* >>
*Alert Rules Engine*.

From here, you’ll select *“+ Add a Rule”* and define your particular
`Matching
Condition <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/transmogrifier-matching-conditions/>`__
for the rule (the condition you want the webhook fired on).  In this
example, we’ll be doing when the state_message contains the phrase
“escalate to dev” anywhere in it.

.. figure:: images/Custom-Outgoing-Webhooks_Alert-Rules-Engine.png
   :alt: VictorOps Rules Alert Engine, when state_message matches
   *escalate to dev*, transform vo-webhook-field to ocasto.com set

   VictorOps Rules Alert Engine, when state_message matches *escalate to
   dev*, transform vo-webhook-field to ocasto.com set

In the “Transform these alert fields” portion, we’ll create a new field
called “vo-webhook-field” and populate it with part of the destination
URL you’re sending the webhook to.

In this example, the full destination URL we’re hoping to send to is
“https://dev.oscato.com/2tn6xfh” so we’ll put “oscato.com” as the
vo-webhook-field value.

Next, you’ll navigate to Outgoing Webhooks under *Integrations* >>
*Outgoing Webhooks*. Select *Add Webhook*.

Here, select the Event you want the webhook to fire on in addition to
the Method and Content Type you want for it.

In the “To:” field, you’ll paste in your destination URL while replacing
the part you’d pasted in the Rules Engine rule with
${{ALERT.vo-webhook-field}}.

In this example, the full destination URL we want the webhook to go to
is “https://dev.oscato.com/2tn6xfh” and we’d put “oscato.com” in the
Rules Engine rule, so the complete “To:” URL will be
“https://dev.${{ALERT.vo-webhook-field}}/2tn6xfh”

This will make it so that the URL is only complete (thus allowing the
webhook to successfully fire) when the “vo-webhook-field” is present,
which will only be present when the Rules Engine matching condition is
met.

Fill out the Payload information with the desired fields you want
included in the webhook, add an optional description, and you’re all set
with a conditionally firing webhook!
