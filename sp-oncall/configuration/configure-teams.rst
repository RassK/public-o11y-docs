Configuring teams is easy with Splunk On-Call. Teams can have multiple
escalation policies within them and may also include any number of
users, with or without a
`rotation <http://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/rotations/>`__.

Teams may have one or more on-call
`rotations <http://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/rotations/>`__ to
help make scheduling easy.

Creating a Team
---------------

To create a team, select “Add Team”, choose a name, and then you are
ready to setup that team’s schedule/rotations and escalation policies.

|Teams page with Add Teams button| Typically, teams will have groups of
users in an on-call rotation, however, escalation policies may include
no users at all and utilize a web-hook, or an email address instead.

After creating your team, you’ll have the option to add
`rotations <http://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/rotations/>`__, and
then setup the team’s `escalation
policies <http://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/team-escalation-policy/>`__.
To learn more about routing specific alerts to specific teams, visit the
knowledge base article on `incident
routing <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/reroute-an-incident/>`__.
