In order to send alerts using the VictorOps service you will need to
have an alert rule (found at Settings >> Alerts) which specifies which
alerts will utilize the service. For an initial verification that alerts
will pass to VictorOps you an create a rule to trigger on “any event”
which notifies the VictorOps service. You may need to spoof an alert to
reach VictorOps.

You are done. If you have any questions please reach out to the
