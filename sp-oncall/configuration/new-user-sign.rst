Username Best Practice
------------------------------

When inviting new users to the Splunk On-Call platform, it is important to consider the following:

-  Each user is responsible for setting up their own username at the time of registration.
-  Usernames cannot be changed.
-  Splunk On-Call does not enforce naming conventions, so it is your responsibility as an administrator to choose and enforce a naming convention.
-  Usernames are global, not unique to your organization. If a username that fits your naming convention is not available, consider appending the username with your organization name. For example, if john.smith is taken, try john.smith.bobsITshop is probably available. Putting the organization name at the end ensures that users in Splunk On-Call can still use the auto-drop-down lists when they begin typing another user's username when using the chat function.

You want to make a username that is recognizable to everyone in your organization. We find these naming conventions to work best:

-  First name - last name (johnsmith, john.smith)
-  First initial last name (jsmith, j.smith)
-  Match your email naming convention

.. Note:: If you are using HipChat or Slack, you will want to match your Splunk On-Call usernames to your chat usernames.

Complete your Profile
============================

Once you have successfully created a username and password, VictorOps
will take you to the `main
timeline <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/timeline/>`__ of the
platform. As with any web page in the portal, direct your attention to
the top right-hand corner of the screen where you can click your

Set up your Paging Policy

Located shortly below your contact methods, you will see your “Paging
Policy”. This is how VictorOps will notify you if an incident comes in
when you are on-call. Build out your Paging Policy to ensure that you
are properly notified when an incident comes in. You have the option to
add additional steps within steps, by using the *plus sign* button, or
you can add additional steps by using the *Add a Step* button.
