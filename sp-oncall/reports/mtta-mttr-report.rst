   :description: About the user roll in Splunk On-Call.

The Response Metrics MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge) and MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) Report tells the story of your investment in Splunk On-Call and the practice of DevOps. Track evolution and goals over time, and tell key stakeholders the story by relaying key metrics directly related to the cost of downtime.

Navigate to :guilabel:`Reports` then :guilabel:`Response Metrics`.

Response metrics graph view
===========================

By default, the MTTA and MTTR lines will be displayed in the graph view if incidents are present in a specific time period. Incidents are displayed in vertical columns to relay the aggregated incident number in a specific timeframe, while also displaying the individual incidents making up the time range.

Select and deselect items in the Graph key to include the data points that are important to you.

-  Hover over an incident to learn key metrics, and click an individual incident to get the granular information surrounding a specific data point. For the bucket averages, only the hover state is available.

-  Select individual incidents to drill into more granular incident data.

-  Select and deselect items in the Graph Key to include the data points that are important to you.

Track response metrics with team filtering
==========================================

Track both your organization and team's MTTA and MTTR and incident metrics by leveraging the team filter. These are directly related to the associated team's escalation policies.

about a specific incident, including its ACK/RES history, as well as the
individual alert payload.

CSV Download
============

The data delivered in the CSV will reflect the date range and team
segmenting designed in the setting views. Changing the segment by
filters and date range bucketing will have no effect on the contents of
the download.

Things to note about the CSV
----------------------------

-  Timestamps are at millisecond granularity
-  CSV is sorted by Incident ID in descending order
