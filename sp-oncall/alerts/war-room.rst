The War Room interface pops out from the incident pane, allowing teams to better digest incident context and mobilize on-call teams. From this view, incident responders can track critical incident metrics such as time to detection/acknowledgement and find related integrations such as ServiceNow tickets and Slack channels associated with the incident. With the capability for responders to digest monitoring data, spin up a conference bridge, add other responders, execute runbooks and communicate in one place, this is where problems get solved.

War Room View and Capabilities
================================

The War Room display gives users a way to communicate, take action onincidents, and automatically update or look at related :ref:`Slack <slack-spoc>` channel or :ref:`ServiceNow <snow-spoc>` tickets helping individual responders share applicable context with related stakeholders in the places they're already working. In one single place, on-call responders can find instructions and tools such as runbooks, wikis, dashboards or post-incident review documentation to diagnose exactly how they can fix a problem. In that same place, you can reroute alerts or add :ref:`suggested responders <multi-responder>` to an incident and communicate through your preferred conference call software and/or chat tool to effectively respond to a major problem.
