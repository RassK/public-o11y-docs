The War Room interface pops out from the incident pane, allowing teams
to better digest incident context and mobilize on-call teams. From this
view, incident responders can track critical incident metrics such as
time to detection/acknowledgement and find related integrations such as
ServiceNow tickets and Slack channels associated with the incident. With
the capability for responders to digest monitoring data, spin up a
conference bridge, add other responders, execute runbooks and
communicate in one place, this is where problems get solved.

**War Room View and Capabilities** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The War Room display gives users a way to communicate, take action on
incidents, and automatically update or look at related
`Slack <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/slack-integration-guide/>`__ channels
or `ServiceNow <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/servicenow-bi-directional-integration-guide/>`__ tickets
– helping individual responders share applicable context with related
stakeholders in the places they're already working. In one single place,
on-call responders can find instructions and tools such as runbooks,
wikis, dashboards or post-incident review documentation to diagnose
exactly how they can fix a problem. In that same place, you can reroute
alerts or add `suggested
responders <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/multi-responder-incident-response/>`__ to
an incident and communicate through your preferred `conference
call <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/conference-bridge/>`__
software and/or chat tool to effectively respond to a major problem.
