**Setting up your account**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Accept your email invitation** 

2. **Create a username if one has not been created for you:** Keep in
   mind that *usernames* **cannot** *be changed.* Please be sure to
   follow any naming conventions outlined by your account admins. 

3. **Add contact methods to your profile:** Add the contact methods that
   you would like to be reached on (phone numbers, emails). **For push
   notifications:** First, download the mobile app and log in. Your
   device will then appear in your profile and you will be able to use
   push notifications.

4. **Set up your Personal Paging Policies: Your paging policy
   determines** \_how\_*\* Splunk On-Call notifies you of an incident.
   Include*\* **multiple steps and multiple notification types** in your
   policy that increase in noise such as push to SMS to a phone call.
   *NOTE: the last step of your paging policy will repeat until the
   incident is acknowledged.* **Quick video on** `Personal Paging
   Policies <https://share.vidyard.com/watch/gpRuaMFxCK8wZyB9oFRXBA?>`__\ **!** 

   **♦** **Best Practice Tip** **♦ Your Primary Paging Policy should be
   the loudest and most attention-grabbing notification method. While
   your custom paging policy can be less aggressive for a configured
   period time that may not require such aggressive paging (i.e. during
   business hours).**

   **♦** **Best Practice Tip** **♦ Include a phone call in the last step
   of your paging policy so that you are alerted in the noisiest way
   until you acknowledge the incident.**

5. **Download Mobile App & Add Splunk On-Call to your contacts:** Splunk
   On-Call can be easily added to your phone contacts from the mobile
   app. Just navigate to the Menu, Notifications, and select “Add Splunk
   On-Call to Contacts”. *NOTE: if you need Splunk On-Call notifications
   to override “Do Not Disturb” please visit our mobile application
   articles for directions.*

   personal calendar .ics file to your favorite calendar tools such as
   Google or Outlook.

7. **Create a Scheduled Override:** Heading out of town or have a
   scheduled absence where you will need on-call coverage? Create an
   override so someone can cover your shift for you. \****Quick video on

   -  **Mobile:** From the home screen select “Create Override” and
      select the timezone and dates/times you need to be covered.

   -  **Web:** Navigate to your team >> Scheduled Overrides >> Create an
      Override and select the timezone and dates/time you need to be
      covered. *NOTE:* **Another user will need to “take” the shift(s)
      from you before the shift is considered covered**

8. **Use the Manual Take On-Call feature for last-minute coverage:** For
   unplanned absences (i.e. a doctor’s appointment), the take on-call
   button can be used to cover another user’s shift until they take it
   back or the shift ends. **Quick video on** `Manual
   Takes <https://share.vidyard.com/watch/Jfm3pcAxRkpw8bQE4JF91i?>`__\ **!**

   different actions you can take on an incident you are paged for. The
   various actions are described below: \****Quick video on incident
   actions on the `Web
   UI <https://share.vidyard.com/watch/Nd1KzLjZKbSnRvAdnhgDcW?>`__ &
   `Mobile
   UI <https://share.vidyard.com/watch/mkPu5XngyjgyNnrpRCSx1Q?>`__!***\* 

   -  **Acknowledge**: This will stop the incident from actively paging
      and continuing through the escalation policy. An acknowledgment
      signifies that you are aware of an incident and are taking action
      on it.
   -  **Resolve**: Once the incident is resolved within the monitoring
      tool it can be resolved within Splunk On-Call. Once resolved any
      new alert of the same type will create a new incident.
   -  **Reroute**: If the incident needs to be addressed by another user
      or directed to a different escalation policy the reroute option
      allows you to do this. 
   -  **Snooze**: If the incident is not urgent and can wait before
      being address you can snooze it for a specified amount of time
      using the snooze option. The incident will page users again after
      the amount of time selected is up.
   -  **Add Responders/Conference Bridge**: If more eyes are needed on
      an incident and/or a Conference Bridge is needed to troubleshoot
      the incident, you can click the Add Responders icon and send out a
      page to desired users or particular escalation policies.
   -  **Chat**: Chat in the incident timeline to collaborate with
      teammates

      -  use @ to notify specific users
      -  use @@ to notify a specific team
