IMPORTANT - How to Contact Splunk On-Call Support
-------------------------------------------------

There are three different ways to contact **Splunk On-Call (formerly
VictorOps)** Support:

1. **Live Chat:** If you are logged into your Splunk On-Call instance,
   you have the ability to Live Chat with the Splunk On-Call Support
   team via our in-product chat feature. This is the fastest, easiest
   way to reach Splunk On-Call Support. A Live Chat with a Technical
   Support Engineer will also open an On-Call Support case. 
2. **Splunk Support Portal:** If you have the correct permissions (an
   “entitlement”) you may open a Splunk On-Call support case in the
   Splunk Support Portal: https://login.splunk.com/ This path requires
   that you log into the Splunk Support Portal, which is a different
   login than the Splunk On-Call product login. If this is the first
   time you’ve accessed the portal, please follow the directions
   outlined below.
3. **Call Center:** If you don’t have access to your On-Call instance or
   the Support Portal, please `call our hotline to be routed to On-Call
   Support <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk/contact-us.html#customer-support>`__.
   This path will require you to specify that your question is for the
   Splunk On-Call product.
