Scheduled Overrides allow users to request on-call coverage for planned
absences. If a current shift needs to be covered on short notice, visit
the `Manual
Take <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/manual-take-call/>`__
article to learn how to perform a manual take.

--------------

Scheduling an Override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From within any team’s page select, *Scheduled Overrides,* and then,
*Schedule an Override.*

A pop-out window will appear to choose who the override will be for as
well as the start and end dates and times.

**NOTE:** Overrides can not be scheduled within 30 minutes of the
current time.

**Once the override has been created, a user (or users) still need to be
assigned to the override!  If the override remains unassigned, the
original user will remain on-duty.**

Assigning an Override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**NOTE:** Global Admins can assign anyone to scheduled overrides, while
Team Admins are able to create and assign overrides for anyone on their
team.

In order to view all overrides, only your team’s overrides, or only your
personal overrides, make sure to select the desired view on the
drop-down under the scheduled override description.

Click the carrot icon to the right of the override to view the
escalation policies which need to be assigned.

For each escalation policy, pick the user from the dropdown who will be
assigned to the override.

If only a particular escalation policy needs to be assigned and the
original user is still to be on-call for their other escalation
policies, be sure to select the original user as the “override user” to
keep them on-call.

Taking an Override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are the user who will be covering someone’s override, simply
select “Take” next to the escalation policy which you are to cover.

View the Override on the On-Call Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see the override on the On-Call Schedule, navigate to the On-Call
Schedule tab within the team for which the user is to be covered.

Expand the on-call schedule by clicking on the carrot icon to right. The
override will show as an orange block and the user’s username who is now
on-call for the given time will be present as well.

Scheduled Overrides via Mobile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see how to create, assign, and view Scheduled Overrides via mobile
visit our mobile overrides page
`HERE <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/mobile-app-schedule-scheduled-overrides/>`__.

Email sent out if Scheduled Overrides remain unassigned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is a scheduled override that remains unassigned and begins
within the next 7 days, an email will be sent out to Admins (Global
and/or Team). This email will be sent out at roughly 2 AM UTC with
reminders to provide coverage on these overrides.  Global Admins will
see all the account’s overrides in the email within this threshold,
while Team Admins will only receive an email for their Team’s scheduled
overrides within that upcoming week.

In order to not receive these emails, all scheduled overrides need to be
assigned to either another user or the original user as the “override
user” to keep them on-call.
