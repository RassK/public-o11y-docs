   information and Paging Policy.

This will automatically create a new contact with all 5 numbers already included.

This will also give you the option to save Splunk On-Call to your Favorites, in order to ensure that calls from Splunk On-Call are able to override Do Not Disturb mode. It also allows you to give the Splunk On-Call contact Emergency Bypass capabilities, ensuring that you will always get your phone and SMS notifications regardless of the state of your phone (provided it is turned on).

Primary Paging Policy
===========================

It is important that you have a diverse and robust Primary Paging Policy in place so this is the first setting we recommend
configuring. This article will help you navigate to and edit the Personal Paging Policy feature on both iOS and Android systems. Within
the Splunk On-Call Mobile App, you are able to easily view and update your paging policies from iOS and Android devices.

iOS
======

In the Splunk On-Call Mobile App, select :guilabel:`Users` at the bottom of your iOS device's screen. Then select the person icon from
the :guilabel:`Users` page.

From your User Profile page, you can select the :guilabel:`Paging Policies` tab to view your current configuration. If you'd like to change your paging policy select :guilabel:`Edit`. Here you may delete, update, or add steps to your :guilabel:`Primary Paging Policy` and :guilabel:`Custom Paging Policies` to your iOS device. Once complete, be sure to save your changes.

Android
==============

As with iOS devices, editing and creating :guilabel:`Primary Paging Policy` and :guilabel:`Custom Paging Policies` in the Splunk On-Call mobile app is only a few clicks away. Select the :guilabel:`Users` icon at the bottom, then select the person from the resulting Users page. Finally, select the :guilabel:`Paging Policies` tab.

Once you've accessed your :guilabel:`Paging Policies`, select Edit. Select the
step you'd like to :guilabel:`Edit` or :guilabel:`Add steps`.
