This will automatically create a new contact with all 5 numbers already
included.

This will also give you the option to save Splunk On-Call to your
Favorites, in order to ensure that calls from Splunk On-Call are able to
override Do Not Disturb mode.  It also allows you to give the Splunk
On-Call contact “Emergency Bypass” capabilities, ensuring that you will
always get your phone and SMS notifications regardless of the state of
your phone (provided it is turned on).

Primary Paging Policy
---------------------

Please Note: It is important that you have a diverse and robust Primary
Paging Policy in place so this is the first setting we recommend
configuring. This article will help you navigate to and edit the
Personal Paging Policy feature on both iOS and Android systems. Within
the Splunk On-Call Mobile App, you are able to easily view and update
your paging policies from iOS and Android devices.

iOS
~~~

In the Splunk On-Call Mobile App, select the *Users* icon at the bottom
of your iOS device's screen. Then select the person icon from
the *Users* page.

From your User Profile page, you may select the *Paging Policies tab* to
view your current configuration. If you'd like to change your paging
policy select *Edit*. Here you may delete, update, or add steps to
your *Primary Paging Policy and Custom Paging Policies* from your iOS
device. Once complete, be sure to save your changes!

Android
~~~~~~~

As with iOS devices, editing and creating *Primary Paging
Policies* and *Custom Paging Policies* in the Splunk On-Call Mobile App
is only a few clicks away. Select the *Users* icon at the bottom, then
select the person from the resulting Users page. Finally, select
the *Paging Policies* tab.
