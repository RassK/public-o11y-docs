Primary Paging Policy
-----------------------

It is important that you have a diverse and robust Primary Paging Policy in place so this is the first setting we recommend configuring. This article will help you navigate to and edit the Personal Paging Policy feature on both iOS and Android systems. Within the Splunk On-Call Mobile App, you are able to easily view and update your paging policies from iOS and Android devices.

iOS
^^^^^^

In the Splunk On-Call Mobile App, select the :guilabel:`Users` icon at the bottom of your iOS device's screen. Then select the person icon from the :guilabel:`Users` page.

From your User Profile page, you may select the :guilabel:`Paging Policies` tab to view your current configuration. If you'd like to change your paging policy select *Edit*. Here you may delete, update, or add steps to your Primary Paging Policy and Custom Paging Policies from your iOS device. Once complete, be sure to save your changes.

Android
^^^^^^^^^^^

As with iOS devices, editing and creating Primary Paging Policies and Custom Paging Policies in the Splunk On-Call Mobile App is only a few clicks away. Select the :guilabel:`Users` icon at the bottom, then select the person from the resulting Users page. Finally, select the :guilabel:`Paging Policies` tab.

Once you've accessed your Paging Policies, select :guilabel:`Paging Policies`. Select the step you'd like to edit or add steps to.
