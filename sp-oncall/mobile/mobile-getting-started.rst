Primary Paging Policy
---------------------

It is important that you have a diverse and robust Primary Paging Policy
in place so this is the first setting we recommend configuring. This
article will help you navigate to and edit the Personal Paging Policy
feature on both iOS and Android systems. Within the Splunk On-Call
Mobile App, you are able to easily view and update your paging policies
from iOS and Android devices.

iOS
~~~

In the Splunk On-Call Mobile App, select the *Users* icon at the bottom
of your iOS device’s screen. Then select the person icon from
the *Users* page.

From your User Profile page, you may select the *Paging Policies tab* to
view your current configuration. If you’d like to change your paging
policy select *Edit*. Here you may delete, update, or add steps to
your *Primary Paging Policy and Custom Paging Policies* from your iOS
device. Once complete, be sure to save your changes!

Android
~~~~~~~

As with iOS devices, editing and creating *Primary Paging
Policies* and *Custom Paging Policies* in the Splunk On-Call Mobile App
is only a few clicks away. Select the *Users* icon at the bottom, then
select the person from the resulting Users page. Finally, select
the *Paging Policies* tab.

Once you’ve accessed your *Paging Policies*, select *Edit.* Select the
step you’d like to *Edit* or *Add Step*.
