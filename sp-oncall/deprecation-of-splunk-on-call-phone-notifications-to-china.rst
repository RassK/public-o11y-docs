**Effective September 29th, 2023:**

As you may know, we are all experiencing increased restrictions and
regulations between the U.S. and China. As a company, Splunk has decided
to **no longer provide voice call notifications** to responders in the 
+86 country code (China), effective **September 29th, 2023**.

In response, affected end-users are encouraged to configure `personal
paging
policies <https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/paging-policy-setup/>`__ to
diversify their *Splunk On-Call* notification methods (i.e., SMS, Push,
and Email notification methods). Please note that the *Splunk On-Call*
product continues to be supported globally, and all functionality will
be available to customers with responders outside of the +86 country
code (China). Again, please be advised that we will be
deprecating *Splunk On-Call* voice call notification service for +86
country code (China) effective on **September 29th, 2023**. We sincerely
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
