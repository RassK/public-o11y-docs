Splunk On-Call is incident management software that allows teams to maintain a culture of high availability without slowing down the innovation process. The moment something goes wrong, Splunk On-Call will spring people to action, automatically. Teams receive context-rich notifications and collaborate cross-functionally to empower fast, efficient incident resolution with reduced downtime. Stakeholders can gain visibility to critical incidents and steps taken to resolve incidents.


If you will be administering your organization's Splunk On-Call instance, the :ref:`admin-getting-started` provides an overview of tasks you need to complete.

If you are an individual user who will be on-call and responding to incidents, the :ref:`spoc-user-guide` will help you become oriented to the Splunk On-Call user interface.



We offer two getting started guides: one for admins and one for users.
