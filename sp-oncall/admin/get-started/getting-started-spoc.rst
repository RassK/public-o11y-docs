Welcome to Splunk On-Call. With Splunk On-Call, developers, devops and operations teams can respond to incidents while reducing mean time to acknowledge and restore outages. Teams receive context-rich notifications and collaborate cross-functionally to empower fast, efficient incident resolution with reduced downtime. Stakeholders can gain visibility to critical incidents and steps taken to resolve incidents.


If you will be administering your organization's Splunk On-Call instance, the :ref:`admin-getting-started` provides an overview of tasks you need to complete.

If you are an individual user who will be on-call and responding to incidents, the :ref:`spoc-user-guide` will help you become oriented to the Splunk On-Call user interface.
