When an incident occurs, it is important to contact a responder who understands that part of the system architecture to fix the problem. You can accomplish this through scheduling. An on-call schedule consists of a rotating group of responders that are assigned shifts for incident response. Use an on-call schedule as a step in your incident workflows.

Follow these steps to create a schedule. See :ref:`rotation-setup` for specific schedule scenarios.


After you save your shifts, review the schedule details to confirm that you've configured your schedule shifts as intended. The schedule preview includes schedule info for up to one year.
