- View metrics. You can create your own custom dashboards, and most monitors provide built-in dashboards as well. For information about dashboards, see {ref}`view-dashboards`.
- View a data-driven visualization of the physical servers, virtual machines, AWS instances, and other resources in your environment that are visible to Infrastructure Monitoring. For information about navigators, see {ref}`use-navigators-imm`.
- Access the Metric Finder and search for metrics sent by the monitor. For information, see {ref}`metrics-finder-and-metadata-catalog`.
